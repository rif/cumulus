Coupling metrics capture the degree of interaction and relationships among source code elements in software systems. A vast majority of existing coupling metrics rely on structural information, which captures interactions such as usage relations between classes and methods or execute after associations. However, these metrics lack the ability to identify conceptual dependencies, which, for instance, specify underlying relationships encoded by developers in identifiers and comments of source code classes. We propose a new coupling metric for object-oriented software systems, namely Relational Topic based Coupling (RTC) of classes, which uses Relational Topic Models (RTM), generative probabilistic model, to capture latent topics in source code classes and relationships among them. A case study on thirteen open source software systems is performed to compare the new measure with existing structural and conceptual coupling metrics. The case study demonstrates that proposed metric not only captures new dimensions of coupling, which are not covered by the existing coupling metrics, but also can be used to effectively support impact analysis.
