A critical issue in software maintenance and evolution is change propagation: given a primary change that is made in order to meet a new or changed requirement, what additional, secondary, changes are needed? We have previously developed techniques for effectively supporting change propagation within design models of intelligent agent systems. In this paper, we propose how this approach is applied to support change propagation within UML design models. Our approach offers a number of advantages in terms of saving substantial time writing hard-coded rules, ensuring soundness and completeness, and at the same time capturing the cascading nature of change propagation. We will also present and discuss the results of an evaluation performed to assess the scalability of our approach.
