Services are highly reusable, flexible and loosely coupled, which makes the evolution and the maintenance of composite services more complex. Evolution of BPEL composite service covers changes of processes, bindings and interfaces. In this paper, an approach is proposed to select and generate test cases during the evolution of BPEL composite service. The approach identifies the changes by using control-flow analysis technique and comparing the paths in new composite service version and the old one using extensible BPEL flow graph (or XBFG). Message flow is appended to the control flow so that XBFG can describe the behavior of composite service integrally. The binding and predicate constraint information added in XBFG elements can be used in path selection and test case generation. Theory analysis and case study both show that the approach is effective, and test cases coverage rate is high for the changes of processes, bindings and interfaces.
