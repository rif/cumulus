<p>
Despite the large number of quality models and publicly available quality assessment tools like PMD, Checkstyle, or FindBugs, very few studies have investigated the use of quality models by developers in their daily activities. One reason for this lack of studies is the absence of integrated environments for monitoring the evolution of software quality. We propose SQUANER (Software QUality ANalyzER), a framework for monitoring the evolution of the quality of object-oriented systems. SQUANER connects directly to the SVN of a system, extracts the source code, and perform quality evaluations and faults predictions every time a commit is made by a developer. After quality analysis, a feedback is provided to developers with instructions on how to improve their code.
