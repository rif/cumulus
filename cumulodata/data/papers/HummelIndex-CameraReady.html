<p>
Although numerous different clone detection approaches have been proposed to date, not a single one is both incremental and scalable to very large code bases. They thus cannot provide real-time cloning information for clone management of very large systems. We present a novel, index-based clone detection algorithm for type 1 and 2 clones that is both incremental and scalable. It enables a new generation of clone management tools that provide real-time cloning information for very large software. We report on several case studies that show both its suitability for real-time clone detection and its scalability: on 42 MLOC of Eclipse code, average time to retrieve all clones for a file was below 1 second; on 100 machines, detection of all clones in 73 MLOC was completed in 36 minutes.
