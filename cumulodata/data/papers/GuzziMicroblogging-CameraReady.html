Software engineers spend a considerable amount of time on program comprehension. Although vendors of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and analysis tools address this challenge, current support for reusing and sharing program com- prehension knowledge is limited. As a consequence, developers have to go through the time-consuming program understanding phase multiple times, instead of recalling knowledge from their past or other's program comprehension activities. In this paper, we present an approach to making the knowledge gained during the program comprehension process accessible, by combining micro-blog messages with interaction data automatically collected from the IDE. We implemented the approach in an Eclipse plugin called James and performed a first evaluation of the underlying approach effectiveness, assessing the nature and usefulness of the collected messages, as well as the added benefit of combining them with interaction data.
