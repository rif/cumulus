Localizing and repairing defects are critical software engineering activities. Not all programs and not all bugs are equally easy to debug, however. We present formal models, backed by a human study involving 65 participants (from both academia and industry) and 1830 total judgments, relating various software- and defect-related features to human accuracy at locating errors. Our study involves example code from Java textbooks, helping us to control for both readability and complexity. We find that certain types of defects are much harder for humans to locate accurately. For example, humans are over five times more accurate at locating “extra statements” than “missing statements” based on experimental observation. We also find that, independent of the type of defect involved, certain code contexts are harder to debug than others. For example, humans are over three times more accurate at finding defects in code that provides an array abstraction than in code that provides a tree abstraction. We identify and analyze code features that are predictive of human fault localization accuracy. Finally, we present a formal model of debugging accuracy based on those source code features that have a statistically significant correlation with human performance.
