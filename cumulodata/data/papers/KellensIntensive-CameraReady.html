Companies nowadays rely on outsourcing for the implementation of their software. While outsourcing can reduce the actual development costs for a piece of software, it can also reduce a company's control over the quality of the delivered software. In light of obtaining maintainable software, it is however important that the delivered software is well-structured and obeys the various design rules that were postulated by a company using an outsourcing partner. This paper reports on a collaboration between academia and industry, where the research tool IntensiVE has been applied to verify the design rules underlying a large-scale COBOL system. We describe how the IntensiVE tool was customized in order to support verification of the COBOL system, and how this academic tool aided in providing an initial quality assessment of the outsourced software system.
