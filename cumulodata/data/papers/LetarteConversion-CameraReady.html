Large scale software model checking is a difficult problem in part because of the complexity created by interprocedural function calling. Fastest current solution for this problem claim a polynomial time for only a partial resolution. Static analysis suffers of the same complexity but some work has observed linear time and space complexity for some specific problems. Our research describes how we can adapt these specific inter-procedural static analysis to model-checking and prove the linear complexity of the analysis. Construction of the graph automaton for model checking is described using graph rewriting rules applied on the control flow graph and its application to a medium scale real application.
