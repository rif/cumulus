Software inspections allow finding and removing defects close to their point of injection and are considered a cheap and effective way to detect and remove defects. A lot of research work has focused on understanding the sources of variability and improving software inspections performance. In this paper we studied the impact of inspection review rate in process performance. The study was carried out in an industrial context effort of bridging the gap from CMMI level 3 to level 5. We supported a decision for process change and improvement based on statistical significant information. Study results led us to conclude that review rate is an important factor affecting code inspections performance and that the applicability of statistical methods was useful in modeling and predicting process performance.
