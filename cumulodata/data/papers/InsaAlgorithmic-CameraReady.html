This work presents DDJ, an algorithmic debugger for Java. The main advantage of DDJ with respect to previous algorithmic debuggers is its scalability. DDJ has a new architecture based on the use of cache memories that allows it to scale both in time and memory. In addition, it includes new techniques that allow the debugger to start the debugging session even before the execution tree has been produced. We present the new architecture, and describe the main features of this debugger together with a usage scenario.
