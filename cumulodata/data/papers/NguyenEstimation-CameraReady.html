This paper provides a brief description of our study proposing improvements to the COCOMO models for estimating maintenance size and effort. The proposed size and effort models take into account characteristics of software maintenance that have not been addressed in the current COCOMO models. We found that the proposed models potentially improve the estimation accuracies of software maintenance projects.
