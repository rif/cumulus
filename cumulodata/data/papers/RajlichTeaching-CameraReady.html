During the last decade, software engineering changed rapidly, from the emphasis on waterfall lifecycle to the emphasis on software evolution and agile programming. This tutorial provides a brief introduction and overview of the results of this development. It presents agile programming, Personal and Team Software Process, software change, concept location, refactoring, and so forth. The organizing principle is an outline of an undergraduate software engineering course that is based on these results. The audience interested in this tutorial may be teachers of software engineering, and also software practitioners who want learn how these results fit together and how to apply them in software projects.
