This paper is an industrial report on a project for migrating an airport management system from a Bull mainframe using COBOL as a programming language and IDS as a database system to a distributed UNIX platform using Java and Oracle. The focus here is on the automated language transformation, performed in three phases -- reengineering, conversion and refinement. The tools used are COBRedo for reengineering the COBOL code, COB2Java for converting COBOL to Java and JavRedoc for documenting the converted Java code. The paper describes the migration process and the tools used in it and the reviews the current state of the project. Keywords: Migration, Reengineering, Legacy systems, COBOL, Java, Object-oriented transformation.
