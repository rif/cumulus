This paper explores the use of context sensitivity both intra- and interprocedurally in a blended (static/dynamic) program analysis for identifying source of object churn in framework- intensive Web-based applications. Empirical experiments with an existing blended analysis algorithm [10] compare combinations of (i) use of a context-insensitive call graph with a context-sensitive calling context tree, and (ii) use (or not) of context-sensitive code pruning within methods. These experiments demonstrate achievable gains in scalability and performance in terms of several metrics designed for blended escape analysis, and report results in terms of object instances created, to allow more realistic conclusions from the data than were possible previously.
