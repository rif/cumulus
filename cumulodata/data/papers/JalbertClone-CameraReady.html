<p>
In this paper we propose an active testing approach that uses clone detection and rule evaluation as the foundation for detecting bug patterns in concurrent software. If we can identify a bug pattern as being present then we can localize our testing effort to the exploration of interleavings relevant to the potential bug. Furthermore, if the potential bug is indeed a real bug, then targeting specific thread interleavings instead of examining all possible executions can increase the probability of the bug being detected sooner.
